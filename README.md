## REACT APP

Basic Tools needed to work with ReactJS
React: To work with react we need to install itâ€™s dependencies like react, react-dom, etc.
Babel: ReactJS uses JSX syntax to speed up the development process. But the syntax is not understandable by browsers. So, we need a transcompiler (Babel) to convert JSX into a javascript code.
Webpack: It is a javascript code bundler. In ReactJS we deal with the components so, every component is written in a seperate file to quickly navigate to the component and make changes. It will be difficult to add all these files to webpage. So, we use webpack to to bundle all these components.
